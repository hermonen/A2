/* Read the words from a filename and return a linked list of the words.

 *     welcome to also handle Window line endings ("\r\n"), but you are not
 *     required to, and we will test your code on files with Linux line endings.
 *   - The time complexity of adding one word to this list must be O(1)
 *     which means the linked list will have the words in reverse order
 *     compared to the order of the words in the file.
 *   - Do proper error checking of fopen, fclose, fgets
